# Xilinx_FPGA_HLS-Mapping-algorithm-to-hardware
At present, just a example to show how to map a deep learning detection algorithm YOLOv2 from model to FPGA
There are three steps:
(1)Convert the weight and bias from yolov2.weight to one special format that we need(yolov2 weights and bias file).
(2).......
